<https://github.com/Ray-Hossain/Watermarking-Program---PFDArespository>

## Description
A program that, when given your own personal watermark, will superimpose it onto a given image. A good tool for artists that want to post their work without fear of it being stolen.

## Features
- Takes in watermark image(s)
	- Give the path to the watermark image(s) inside the program.
- Takes in an image that the user wants to be watermarked.
	- Give the path of the image or piece.
- Places the watermark(s) on top of the image.
	- The watermark(s) will be placed randomly on the image while still being contained within the size of the image. The opacity of the watermark(s) will be lowered as to not overtake the image.
- Add metadata to the image.
    - User will add any kind of metadata to the image, such as their username on social media websites, the program they used to create the image, etc.

## Challenges
- How to add metadata to an image.
- How to resize a watermark if it is too big.
- How to give the option to use differnt blending modes if user wants to use them.
